# ReactNodeReadingList
Proof of Concept to create a Personal Reading List using ReactJS and Node + Express + MongoDB backend and gulp for task handling. Used TypeScript for NodeJS api.

Steps:

1) Clone the repository

2) Install MongoDB and in command prompt go to the MongoDB folder and run the following command. 

 **$mongod**

This will get the mongodb up and running.

3) In command prompt go to the root directory of the repoisitory and run the command. This should install the necessary npm packages

 **$npm install**

4) Go into "server" folder and run 

 **$npm install**

5) Go into "client" folder and run

 **$npm install**

6) run the following command from the root folder to get the node api running

 **$gulp**

7) If you need a server to run the app under, you can use the mongoose server included at the root. Just double click it and to the url. Ideally we should use express's routes to render the right html but for this POC, I decided to keep things easy.
